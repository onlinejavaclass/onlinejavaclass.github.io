# Concurrency design patterns
## Saga pattern

This pattern is used in distributed services to perform a group of operations atomically. This is an analog of transaction in a database but in terms of microservices architecture this is executed in a distributed environment.

```
A saga is a sequence of local transactions in a certain context. If one transaction fails for some reason, the saga executes compensating transactions(rollbacks) to undo the impact of the preceding transactions. There are two types of Saga:
```

+ Choreography-Based Saga. In this approach, there is no central orchestrator. Each service participating in the Saga performs their transaction and publish events. The other services act upon those events and perform their transactions. Also, they may or not publish other events based on the situation.

* Orchestration-Based Saga In this approach, there is a Saga orchestrator that manages all the transactions and directs the participant services to execute local transactions based on events. This orchestrator can also be though of as a Saga Manager.


![saga](data/archive/design-patterns/concurrency/assets/saga.png)

```
The major difference with choreography saga is an ability to handle crashed services
(otherwise in choreography services very hard to prevent a saga if one of them has been crashed)
```

#### Usage:

Use the Saga pattern, if:

* you need to perform a group of operations related to different microservices atomically
* you need to rollback changes in different places in case of failure one of the operation
* you need to take care of data consistency in different places including different databases
* you can not use 2PC(two phase commit)

#### Example:

In this article we'll cover an example for a booking hotel and flight store running on different services -microservices- 
Then we apply two methods for the same project. 

##### Choreography-Based Saga

In this approach, there is no central orchestrator. Each service participating in the Saga performs their transaction and publish events. 
The other services act upon those events and perform their transactions. Also, they may or not publish other events based on the situation.

#### Saga representation

**Saga** consists of chapters. Every **ChoreographyChapter** is executed a certain service.

Inner class ***Chapter*** Class presents a chapter status and incoming parameters(incoming parameter transforms to outcoming parameter)

We need a **ChoreographyChapter** as an interface representing a contract for an external service. 
In this case, a service needs to make a decision what to do further hence the server needs to get all context representing **Saga**

~
public interface ChoreographyChapter {

  /**
   * In that case, every method is responsible to make a decision on what to do then.
   *
   * @param saga incoming saga
   * @return saga result
   */
  Saga execute(Saga saga);

  /**
   * get name method.
   *
   * @return service name.
   */
  String getName();

  /**
   * The operation executed in general case.
   *
   * @param saga incoming saga
   * @return result {@link Saga}
   */
  Saga process(Saga saga);

  /**
   * The operation executed in rollback case.
   *
   * @param saga incoming saga
   * @return result {@link Saga}
   */
  Saga rollback(Saga saga);

}

~

We write another class for representing a service discovery pattern. (Remember services are distributed? )

~
public class ServiceDiscoveryService {
  private final Map<String, ChoreographyChapter> services;

  /**
   * find any service.
   *
   * @return any service
   * @throws NoSuchElementException if no elements further
   */
  public ChoreographyChapter findAny() {
    return services.values().iterator().next();
  }

  public Optional<ChoreographyChapter> find(String service) {
    return Optional.ofNullable(services.getOrDefault(service, null));
  }

  public ServiceDiscoveryService discover(ChoreographyChapter chapterService) {
    services.put(chapterService.getName(), chapterService);
    return this;
  }

  public ServiceDiscoveryService() {
    this.services = new HashMap<>();
  }


}
~


Then we implement a general contract abstract **Service** class which representing services.  

~
public abstract class Service implements ChoreographyChapter {

  private final ServiceDiscoveryService sd;

  public Service(ServiceDiscoveryService service) {
    this.sd = service;
  }

  @Override
  public com.metao.dp.saga.choreography.Saga execute(com.metao.dp.saga.choreography.Saga saga) {
    var nextSaga = saga;
    Object nextVal;
    var chapterName = saga.getCurrent().getName();
    if (chapterName.equals(getName())) {
      if (saga.isForward()) {
        nextSaga = process(saga);
        nextVal = nextSaga.getCurrentValue();
        if (nextSaga.isCurrentSuccess()) {
          nextSaga.forward();
        } else {
          nextSaga.back();
        }
      } else {
        nextSaga = rollback(saga);
        nextVal = nextSaga.getCurrentValue();
        nextSaga.back();
      }

      if (isSagaFinished(nextSaga)) {
        return nextSaga;
      }

      nextSaga.setCurrentValue(nextVal);
    }
    var finalNextSaga = nextSaga;

    return sd.find(chapterName).map(ch -> ch.execute(finalNextSaga))
            .orElseThrow(serviceNotFoundException(chapterName));
  }

  private Supplier<RuntimeException> serviceNotFoundException(String chServiceName) {
    return () -> new RuntimeException(
            String.format("the service %s has not been found", chServiceName));
  }

  @Override
  public com.metao.dp.saga.choreography.Saga process(com.metao.dp.saga.choreography.Saga saga) {
    var inValue = saga.getCurrentValue();
    System.out.printf("The chapter '%s' has been started. "
                    + "The data %s has been stored or calculated successfully",
            getName(), inValue);
    saga.setCurrentStatus(com.metao.dp.saga.choreography.Saga.ChapterResult.SUCCESS);
    saga.setCurrentValue(inValue);
    return saga;
  }

  @Override
  public com.metao.dp.saga.choreography.Saga rollback(com.metao.dp.saga.choreography.Saga saga) {
    var inValue = saga.getCurrentValue();
    System.out.printf("The Rollback for a chapter '%s' has been started. "

            getName(), inValue);

    saga.setCurrentStatus(com.metao.dp.saga.choreography.Saga.ChapterResult.ROLLBACK);
    saga.setCurrentValue(inValue);
    return saga;
  }

  private boolean isSagaFinished(com.metao.dp.saga.choreography.Saga saga) {
    if (!saga.isPresent()) {
