<h1 id="design-patterns">Design patterns</h1>
<p>Design patterns, as name suggest, are solutions for most commonly (and frequently) occurred problems while designing a software. 
Design patterns help developers efficiently solve common problems in their code. In this article, we learn how to apply design patterns to improve your efficiency in Java or Spring.
I examine the core patterns in play in the Java and Spring framework, as well as how to leverage the unique power of Spring—along with common object-oriented design patterns—to quickly solve problems. 
Learn how to leverage creational, structural, and operational patterns, as well as other framework patterns, when writing Java applications and working with Spring Framework.</p>
<h3 id="1-creational-design-patterns">1. Creational Design Patterns</h3>
<p>Creational patterns often used in place of direct instantiation with constructors. They make the creation process more adaptable and dynamic. In particular, they can provide a great deal of flexibility about which objects are created, how those objects are created, and how they are initialized.</p>

<h3 id="2-structural-design-patterns">2. Structural Design Patterns</h3>
<p>Structural design patterns show us how to glue different pieces of a system together in a flexible and extensible fashion. These patterns help us guarantee that when one of the parts changes, the entire application structure does not need to change.    </p>
