<h2 id="strategy-pattern">Strategy pattern</h2>
<pre><code>A strategy to determine the best algorithm to use and avoid if-else and switches
</code></pre><p>Strategy pattern defines family of algorithms which are encapsulated and are interchangeable at run time depending on a factor that requires a particular algorithm to be executed. Strategy pattern encourages open-close design principle where a class is open for extension but closed for modification.
It is a suitable replacement for if-else or switch-case statements or complex conditional logic within a method. It also leads to more testable code, especially when coupled with IOC.</p>
<h4 id="when-to-use-">When to use:</h4>
<p>Let us assume that you are a Telecom service provider and you provide prepaid recharge facility to the customer. Depending on the recharge amount you would like to provide free SMS and free Talk time offer.
The Telecom service system can have a <strong>TelecomOperator</strong> class. 
On each recharge this class has to determine different offer depending on the recharge amount.</p>

</pre><h4 id="problem">Problem</h4>
<p>Without strategy pattern you would end up having multiple if-else or switch statements to determine the free SMS and free Talk time for different recharge amounts. If there is a new SMS or Talk time offer then you will have to modify the Operator class which violates open close design principle.
It means you violated the open-close principal. You were only allowed to modify not to change the base classes.</p>
<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
<p>Using Strategy pattern each of if statement can be encapsulated as an algorithm and can be selected at run time depending on the recharge amount.</p>
<p>To apply the Strategy here we can introduce a <strong>interface</strong> and provide it&#39;s concrete implementation as <strong>BasicPlan</strong> and <strong>SuperPlan</strong> strategies as shown here</p>

}
</pre><p>With this design we helped to expand our business easily. When required adding a new plan just requires a 
new class to implement the baseclass. So we can actually switch between plans just by passing different plans 
to activePlan() method. Since inside the TelecomOperator PlanStrategy interface is used, so it is adoptable with all the 
implemented classes as well. </p>
<pre><code>Output:
You have 25  SMS and 20 Minute free talk time
You have 50  SMS and 60 Minute free talk time
