<h3 id="new-java8-features">New Java8 Features</h3>
<p>It has been years since Java 8 released over its predator 
Java 7, though I saw it is missed in many today&#39;s codes, 
Today we have new versions of Java 11, 13, 15, 16.
But I thought to have some word on it first. Actually it is so important 
that I need to emphasize this here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One should first know Java8 features if wants to 
    truly take benefit of newer JDKs. e.g. Java11, 15, 16 and so on.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="-optional-so-what-is-about-java-8-">(Optional) So what is about Java 8 ?</h3>
<p>You can skip this. 
One can ask why I need to use Java 8? I worked a lot with previous
version and had no problem so far. Some also find it complex 
to comprehend.<br>So, before we go deep into it let&#39;s clear up something.</p>
<p>Aside from performance and memory improvements, Java 8 released to make things more flexible and structured. 
You can make things simpler or in reverse more complex, so it does not mean the framework is complex itself.
Let me explain what is Java 8 itself. Actually I see Java 8 emerge not only a new version
of JDK but also a new programming paradigm!</p>
<h3 id="introduction-of-java-8">Introduction of Java 8</h3>
<p>Java 8 introduced functional paradigm in Java world, with Lambda language. 
Actually you still write Java but you can tell Java to take benefit of 
functional programming languages inside Java codes too! </p>
<p>So I just wanted to have a bit of emphasise, the mindset changes here.
Developers with solid and classic Java developing mindset have less willing to learn this new style
and yet the reason we can find why so many projects in Java are still skipped 
to upgrade. </p>
<p>So far whatever we&#39;ve defined and shown in this website were around classic Java. 
You should not think this as a total change to whole code, but to add a flavour to 
part of you code. Actually to make them more clean, understandable, and even more structured.
Still you can write classic java beside you can include functional style
to your work, still getting the same result if you&#39;d do it all classic way.</p>
<p>Specially when we deal with data and arrays and need to play with data to make 
some meaningful info, Java 8 helps us to get rid of complexity of huge classic 
code architecture and as a result lees error prune codes.</p>
